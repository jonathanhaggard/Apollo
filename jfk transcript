The very word "secrecy" is repugnant
in a free and open society
and we are as a people
inherently and historically
opposed to secret societies,
to secret oaths and to secret proceedings.
We decided long ago that the dangers
of excessive and unwarranted concealment
of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers
which are cited to justify it.

Even today,
there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society
by imitating its arbitrary restrictions.
Even today,
there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation
if our traditions do not survive with it.
And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security
will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning
to the very limits of official censorship and concealment.

That I do not intend to permit
to the extent that it is in my control.
And no official of my Administration
whether his rank is high or low
civilian or military
should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news
to stifle dissent
to cover up our mistakes
or to withhold from the press and the public
the facts they deserve to know.
