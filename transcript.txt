Uh, Neil and Buzz
The President of The United States
is in his office now and would like
to say a few words to you.
Over.

That would be an honor.

Go ahead Mr. President this is Houston, Out.

Hello Neil and Buzz,
I am talking to you by telephone
from the Oval Room at the White House,
and this certainly has to be
the most historic telephone call
ever made
I just can't tell you how proud
we all are of what you [have done]
For every American this has to be
the proudest day of our lives,
and for people all over the world
I am sure they, too,
join with [Americans] in recog[nizing]
what an immense feat this is.

Because of what you have done
the heavens have become a part of
man's world,
and as you talk to us from [the]
Sea of Tranquility, it inspires
us to redouble our efforts to
bring peace and tranquility to earth.

For one priceless moment in
the whole history of man
all the people on this earth are truly one
one in their pride in what you have done
and one in our prayers that you will
return safely to earth.
