and then turn around and accuse you

What kind of, uh, freedom is that?
What kind of social or political system is it
when a black man has no voice in court?

Has no nothing on his side other than what the white man
chooses to give.

My brothers and sisters we have to put a stop to this
And it will never be stopped
until we stop it ourselves
